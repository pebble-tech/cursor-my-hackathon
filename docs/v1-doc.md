## Phase 1: Core Features (MVP)

These features are required for the event to function successfully on December 6-7, 2025.

### 1. Participant Management

#### 1.1 Guest Import from Luma

**Purpose:** Import pre-approved participants from Luma event platform

**Process:**

1. Admin exports "going" participants from Luma as CSV
2. CSV contains: `email`, `name`, `luma_id`
3. Admin uploads CSV to platform
4. System validates format and data integrity
5. System creates participant records with `status: registered`
6. System sends welcome email to all imported participants

**CSV Format:**

```csv
email,name,luma_id
john@example.com,John Doe,luma_abc123
sarah@example.com,Sarah Lee,luma_def456
```

**Validation Rules:**

- Email must be valid format
- Email must be unique (no duplicates)
- Name must not be empty
- Luma ID optional but recommended

**Welcome Email Template:**

```
Subject: Welcome to Cursor x Anthropic MY Hackathon!

Hi [Name],

You're registered for Cursor x Anthropic MY Hackathon! 🎉

📱 Access your dashboard:
[Platform URL]

Login with this email to:
• View your check-in QR code
• Access your credits after check-in on Dec 6

📍 Check-in opens: Dec 6, 9:00 AM at Level 2, Monash University

See you soon! 🚀
The Hackathon Team
```

#### 1.2 VIP Management

**Purpose:** Handle VIP guests who don't register via Luma

**Process:**

1. Admin manually adds VIP (name + email)
2. System creates VIP record with `participant_type: vip`
3. System generates permanent QR code immediately
4. VIP cannot login to platform (email-only workflow)
5. On event day, admin manually checks in VIP
6. System sends VIP email with QR code image

**VIP Characteristics:**

- No credit codes assigned
- Permanent QR code (never expires)
- Email-only access (no platform login)
- Special badge shown to ops during scans
- Food access only (no hackathon credits)

**VIP Check-in Email:**

```
Subject: Welcome VIP - Cursor x Anthropic MY Hackathon

Hi [Name],

Welcome to Cursor x Anthropic MY Hackathon! 🌟

🍽️ YOUR VIP FOOD ACCESS

[QR Code Image Embedded]

Show this QR code at food stations for:
• Lunch (Dec 6, 12:00 PM)
• Dinner (Dec 6, 6:00 PM)
• Breakfast (Dec 7, 9:00 AM)

Your QR code never expires. Keep this email handy!

Enjoy the event! 🚀
```

### 2. Authentication System

#### 2.1 Magic Link Login

**Purpose:** Passwordless authentication for participants and staff

**Process:**

1. User visits platform URL
2. User enters email address
3. System validates email exists in database
4. If valid, system generates magic link (expires 1 hour)
5. System sends magic link via email
6. User clicks link to login
7. System creates session (lasts 7 days)

**Email Validation:**

- Email must exist in participant table
- Email must match Luma registration
- Error message if not found: "Email not registered. Please use your Luma registration email."

**Magic Link Email:**

```
Subject: Login to Hackathon Dashboard

Hi [Name],

Click here to login (expires in 1 hour):
[Platform URL]/auth/verify?token=[UUID]

If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.
```

**Security Features:**

- One-time use tokens
- 1-hour expiration
- Token marked as used after login
- 7-day session duration
- Rate limiting: Max 5 requests per 15 minutes per email

#### 2.2 Session Management

**Session Duration:** 7 days  
**Storage:** Server-side session storage  
**Logout:** Manual logout clears session immediately

### 3. QR Code System

#### 3.1 QR Code Generation

**Key Design Decision:** Permanent QR codes (no expiration)

**Rationale:**

- Simpler event day logistics (no refresh issues)
- Works offline (participants can screenshot)
- No clock synchronization problems
- Duplicate prevention handled by session tracking, not timestamps

**QR Code Format:**

```json
{
  "participant_id": "uuid-here",
  "type": "permanent",
  "signature": "hmac-sha256-signature"
}
```

**Generation Timing:**

- **Regular Participants:** Generated on first login
- **VIPs:** Generated when admin adds VIP

**Storage:** QR code value stored in database (`participant.qr_code_value`)

#### 3.2 QR Code Validation

**Server-Side Validation Process:**

1. Decode QR payload
2. Extract `participant_id`
3. Verify HMAC signature
4. Look up participant in database
5. Validate against business rules for selected check-in type

**Validation Logic:**

**For Registration Check-in (Day 1 Attendance):**

```
IF participant.status == "registered":
  ✓ Valid - proceed with check-in
ELSE IF participant.status == "checked_in":
  ✗ Invalid - already checked in
```

**For Other Check-in Types:**

```
IF participant.status != "checked_in":
  ✗ Invalid - must check in at registration first
ELSE:
  Check checkin_records table for checkin_type
  IF already checked in:
    ✗ Invalid - duplicate check-in
  ELSE:
    ✓ Valid - proceed
```

**Security Features:**

- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Server-side validation only (never trust client)
- Rate limiting on validation attempts
- Audit logging of all scans

#### 3.3 QR Code Display

**Participant Dashboard:**

- Large, scannable QR code (300x300px minimum)
- "This QR never expires" message
- Instructions: "Show this at registration desk" or "Show at food stations"
- Can be screenshotted and saved offline

**VIP Email:**

- QR code embedded as image (PNG format)
- High resolution (600x600px)
- Instructions included in email body

### 4. Check-in Process

#### 4.1 Registration Check-in Flow

**Location:** Registration desk, Level 2  
**Time:** Dec 6, 9:00 AM - 11:00 PM  
**Staff:** Ops volunteers with scanner devices

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Participant Actions:**

1. Arrives at registration desk
2. Opens platform on mobile device
3. Navigates to QR code page
4. Shows QR to ops volunteer

**Ops Actions:**

1. Opens ops dashboard
2. Selects "Day 1 Attendance" check-in type
3. Points camera at participant's QR code
4. Waits for scan result
5. Confirms success or handles error

**System Actions:**

1. Decodes QR code payload
2. Verifies signature is valid
3. Looks up participant by `participant_id`
4. Checks current status:
   - If `registered`: Proceed to step 5
   - If `checked_in`: Show error "Already checked in at [time]"
5. Creates checkin_record for "Day 1 Attendance"
6. Updates participant: `status = "checked_in"`, `checked_in_at = NOW()`
7. **Assigns codes** (see 4.2 below)
8. Sends check-in confirmation email
9. Shows success message to ops

**Success Display (Ops):**

```
✓ John Doe
Checked in successfully
6 codes assigned
```

**Error Display (Ops):**

```
⚠️ John Doe
Already checked in at 10:34 AM
```

#### 4.2 Code Assignment Algorithm

**Trigger:** Immediately upon successful check-in  
**Method:** First-come-first-serve from unassigned code pool

**Algorithm:**

```
assigned_codes = []

FOR EACH active_credit_type IN active_credit_types:

  // Lock one unassigned code
  code = SELECT * FROM codes
         WHERE credit_type_id = active_credit_type.id
         AND assigned_to IS NULL
         LIMIT 1
         FOR UPDATE  // Row-level lock

  IF code EXISTS:
    // Assign to participant
    UPDATE codes
    SET assigned_to = participant.id,
        assigned_at = NOW(),
        status = 'available'
    WHERE id = code.id

    assigned_codes.push({
      credit_type: active_credit_type,
      code: code
    })

  ELSE:
    // No codes left for this type
    LOG WARNING: "Code exhausted for {credit_type.name}"
    // Participant won't receive this credit type

END FOR

RETURN assigned_codes
```

**Handling Code Shortages:**

- If a credit type runs out of codes, late participants simply don't receive that credit
- No error shown to participant (they only see what they got)
- Warning logged for admin review
- Email includes only assigned credits

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario A:** Participant #1 (early arrival)

- All 6 credit types have available codes
- Receives codes from: Cursor, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, LeanMCP, Mobbin, Vercel
- Email lists all 6 credits

**Scenario B:** Participant #900 (late arrival)

- Cursor codes exhausted (only 800 available)
- Receives codes from: Anthropic, ElevenLabs, LeanMCP, Mobbin, Vercel
- Email lists only 5 credits
- No mention of Cursor (participant doesn't know it existed)

#### 4.3 Check-in Confirmation Email

**Sent:** Immediately after successful check-in  
**Delivery:** Via Resend API  
**Format:** HTML with embedded QR image

**Email Template:**

````
Subject: You're Checked In! 🎉

You### 5. Credit Management System

#### 5.1 Credit Type Creation

**Purpose:** Define categories of sponsor credits with instructions

**Admin Workflow:**
1. Navigate to Credit Management → Create Credit Type
2. Fill form with required fields
3. Save credit type
4. Credit type becomes available for code import

**Required Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| Name | String | Internal identifier (lowercase, no spaces) | `cursor` |
| Display Name | String | Shown to participants | `Cursor Pro Credits - 50 credits` |
| Email Instructions | Text | Concise text for email | `Login to cursor.com, go to Settings > Billing, paste code` |
| Web Instructions | Rich Text | Detailed HTML/Markdown for dashboard | `<h3>How to Redeem</h3><ol><li>Go to...` |
| Display Order | Integer | Sorting order in lists | `1` |
| Icon URL | String (optional) | Logo/icon for UI | `https://cdn.../cursor.png` |
| Is Active | Boolean | Enable/disable credit type | `true` |

**Business Rules:**
- Name must be unique
- Display order determines sort position in participant dashboard
- Inactive credit types won't assign codes during registration check-in
- Instructions are shared by all codes of this type

**Example Credit Types:**
1. Cursor Pro Credits - 50 credits
2. Anthropic API Credits - 25 credits
3. ElevenLabs Voice AI - 6 month Scale tier
4. LeanMCP Pro - 1 week trial
5. Mobbin Pro - 3 month subscription
6. Vercel Deployment Credits - 5000 credits

#### 5.2 Code Import Process

**Purpose:** Bulk import redemption codes from sponsors

**Prerequisite:** Credit type must be created first

**CSV Format:**
```csv
code,redeem_url
ABC123XYZ,https://cursor.com/redeem
DEF456ABC,https://cursor.com/redeem
GHI789DEF,https://cursor.com/redeem
````

**Admin Workflow:**

1. Receive code CSV from sponsor
2. Navigate to Credit Management
3. Select credit type (e.g., "Cursor")
4. Click "Import Codes"
5. Upload CSV file
6. Review preview: "Will import X codes for [Credit Type]"
7. Confirm import
8. System validates and imports codes

**Validation Rules:**

- CSV must have exactly 2 columns: `code`, `redeem_url`
- Code values must be unique within credit type
- Redeem URL must be valid format
- Max 10,000 codes per import

**Import Result:**

- Success: "1,000 codes imported for Cursor"
- Partial success: "980 codes imported, 20 duplicates skipped"
- Failure: "Import failed: Invalid CSV format"

**Code Status After Import:**

- `status: unassigned`
- `assigned_to: NULL`
- Ready for assignment during registration check-in

#### 5.3 Code Pool Management

**Code Lifecycle:**

1. **Unassigned:** Imported but not assigned to participant
2. **Available:** Assigned to participant, not yet redeemed
3. **Redeemed:** Participant marked as redeemed (self-reported)

**Pool Exhaustion Handling:**

- System assigns codes first-come-first-serve
- When pool exhausts, subsequent participants don't receive that credit type
- No error shown to participant (only see what they got)
- Admin can monitor pool status (Phase 2 feature)

### 6. Check-in System

#### 6.1 Flexible Check-in Types

**Design:** Admin-configurable check-in categories instead of hardcoded meal types.

**Check-in Type Schema:**

| Field        | Type    | Description                            |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| id           | cuid    | Primary key                            |
| name         | text    | Unique name (e.g., "Day 1 Attendance") |
| type         | enum    | 'attendance' or 'meal'                 |
| description  | text    | Instructions shown to ops              |
| displayOrder | int     | Order in ops UI                        |
| isActive     | boolean | Can disable without deleting           |

**Example Check-in Types (seeded by admin):**

| name             | type       | display_order |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Day 1 Attendance | attendance | 1             |
| Day 1 Lunch      | meal       | 2             |
| Day 1 Dinner     | meal       | 3             |
| Day 2 Attendance | attendance | 4             |
| Day 2 Breakfast  | meal       | 5             |

**Business Rules:**

- Each participant can complete each check-in type exactly once
- Must be checked in (Day 1 Attendance) before completing other check-in types
- VIPs can complete check-ins without receiving credits
- Same QR code used for all check-in types
- Admin can add/modify check-in types before event

#### 6.2 Check-in Guest Flow (Ops)

**Purpose:** Fast, single-purpose check-in for a specific type.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Ops Actions:**

1. Opens ops dashboard
2. Selects check-in type from list (e.g., "Day 1 Lunch")
3. Scanner camera activates
4. Scans participant's QR code

**System Actions:**

1. Decodes QR code payload
2. Verifies signature
3. Looks up participant
4. Queries `checkin_records` for this type + participant
5. If record exists: Show error "Already checked in at [time]"
6. If no record:
   - Insert checkin_record
   - Show success with participant name
   - Update real-time counter

**Success Display (Ops):**

```
✓ John Doe
Day 1 Lunch - Checked in successfully
```

**If VIP:**

```
✓ Jane Sponsor 🌟 VIP
Day 1 Lunch - Checked in successfully
```

**Error Display (Ops):**

```
⚠️ John Doe
Already checked in at 12:15 PM
```

#### 6.3 Check Guest Status Flow (Ops)

**Purpose:** View all check-in statuses for a participant.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Ops Actions:**

1. Opens "Check Guest Status" screen
2. Scans participant's QR code

**System Actions:**

1. Verify QR and lookup participant
2. Query all active check-in types (ordered)
3. Left join with checkin_records for this participant
4. Return list with completion status

**Display:**

```
John Doe
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Day 1 Attendance - 9:15 AM
✓ Day 1 Lunch - 12:15 PM
☐ Day 1 Dinner
☐ Day 2 Attendance
☐ Day 2 Breakfast
```

#### 6.4 Duplicate Prevention

**Primary Method:** Database uniqueness constraint

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE checkin_records (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  checkin_type_id TEXT REFERENCES checkin_types(id),
  participant_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  checked_in_by TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  checked_in_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(checkin_type_id, participant_id)
);
```

**Concurrent Scan Protection:**

## 7. Data Models

This section defines the database schema for all entities in the system using **Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL**.

### 7.0 Technology Decision

**Database Stack:** Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (not Convex as mentioned in architecture diagram)

**Rationale:**

- Existing codebase already uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- Better Auth integrates seamlessly with Drizzle adapter
- PostgreSQL supports row-level locking (`FOR UPDATE`) required for first-come-first-serve code assignment
- Strong typing with TypeScript inference

### 7.2 Users Table (Extended Better Auth)

**Description:** Core table storing all participant, VIP, ops, and admin user records. Extends Better Auth's standard user table with hackathon-specific fields.

**Strategy:** Extend Better Auth's `users` table rather than creating a separate `participants` table. This keeps authentication and participant data unified.

**Schema Definition:**

```typescript
// packages/core/src/auth/schema.ts (extended)
import { boolean, index, pgEnum, pgTable, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

// Enums
export const userRoleEnum = pgEnum('user_role', ['participant', 'ops', 'admin']);
export const participantTypeEnum = pgEnum('participant_type', ['regular', 'vip']);
export const participantStatusEnum = pgEnum('participant_status', ['registered', 'checked_in']);

export const UsersTable = pgTable(
  'users',
  {
    // Better Auth standard fields
    id: text('id').primaryKey(),
    name: text('name').notNull(),
    email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
    emailVerified: boolean('email_verified').default(false).notNull(),
    image: text('image'),
    createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
    updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at')
      .defaultNow()
      .$onUpdate(() => new Date())
      .notNull(),

    // Better Auth optional fields
    banned: boolean('banned').default(false),
    banReason: text('ban_reason'),
    banExpires: timestamp('ban_expires'),

    // Hackathon-specific fields (extensions)
    lumaId: text('luma_id'), // Luma event registration ID
    role: userRoleEnum('role').default('participant').notNull(), // Permission level
    participantType: participantTypeEnum('participant_type').default('regular').notNull(),
    status: participantStatusEnum('status').default('registered').notNull(),
    checkedInAt: timestamp('checked_in_at'), // When checked in at registration
    checkedInBy: text('checked_in_by'), // Ops user who checked them in
    qrCodeValue: text('qr_code_value'), // Permanent QR code payload
  },
  (table) => [
    index('users_email_idx').on(table.email),
    index('users_luma_id_idx').on(table.lumaId),
    index('users_status_idx').on(table.status),
    index('users_role_idx').on(table.role),
  ]
);
```

**Field Details:**

| Field           | Type      | Nullable | Default       | Description                                      |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| id              | text      | No       | -             | CUID primary key                                 |
| name            | text      | No       | -             | Display name (from Luma or manual entry)         |
| email           | text      | No       | -             | Unique email address                             |
| emailVerified   | boolean   | No       | false         | Better Auth field                                |
| image           | text      | Yes      | null          | Profile image URL                                |
| lumaId          | text      | Yes      | null          | Luma registration ID for deduplication           |
| role            | enum      | No       | 'participant' | Permission level: participant, ops, admin        |
| participantType | enum      | No       | 'regular'     | Type: regular (gets credits) or vip (no credits) |
| status          | enum      | No       | 'registered'  | Lifecycle: registered → checked_in               |
| checkedInAt     | timestamp | Yes      | null          | Timestamp of registration check-in               |
| checkedInBy     | text      | Yes      | null          | User ID of ops who processed check-in            |
| qrCodeValue     | text      | Yes      | null          | HMAC-signed permanent QR payload                 |
| createdAt       | timestamp | No       | now()         | Record creation time                             |
| updatedAt       | timestamp | No       | now()         | Last update time                                 |

**VIP Handling:**

- VIPs have `participantType: 'vip'` and `role: 'participant'`
- VIPs are created by admin with `status: 'registered'`
- VIPs cannot request magic links (enforced at application level)
- Admin manually checks in VIPs, which triggers QR email

---

### 7.3 Magic Link Authentication (Better Auth Plugin)

**Description:** Magic link authentication is handled by Better Auth's built-in plugin, NOT a custom table. The plugin uses the existing `verifications` table.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// packages/core/src/auth/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { drizzleAdapter } from 'better-auth/adapters/drizzle';
import { magicLink } from 'better-auth/plugins';

import { env } from '~/config/env';
import { db } from '~/drizzle.server';
import { sendMagicLinkEmail } from '~/email/magic-link';

export const auth = betterAuth({
  baseURL: env.APP_BASE_URL,
  trustedOrigins: [env.APP_BASE_URL],
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: 'pg',
    usePlural: true,
  }),
  session: {
    expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
    updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24, // Refresh daily
  },
  plugins: [
    magicLink({
      sendMagicLink: async ({ email, token, url }, ctx) => {
        // Validate user exists and is allowed to login
        const user = await db.query.UsersTable.findFirst({
          where: (users, { eq }) => eq(users.email, email),
        });

        if (!user) {
          throw new Error('Email not registered');
        }

        if (user.participantType === 'vip') {
          throw new Error('VIP accounts cannot login. Please contact organizers.');
        }

        await sendMagicLinkEmail({
          to: email,
          name: user.name,
          magicLinkUrl: url,
        });
      },
      expiresIn: 60 * 60, // 1 hour
      disableSignUp: true, // Only pre-imported users can login
    }),
  ],
});
```

**Client-side Integration:**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/utils/auth-client.ts
import { createAuthClient } from 'better-auth/client';
import { magicLinkClient } from 'better-auth/client/plugins';

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL,
  plugins: [magicLinkClient()],
});

// Usage in login form
const handleLogin = async (email: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await authClient.signIn.magicLink({
    email,
    callbackURL: '/dashboard',
  });
};
```

**Verifications Table (Better Auth managed):**

The `verifications` table is already created by Better Auth and used for magic link tokens:

```typescript
// Already exists in schema - managed by Better Auth
export const VerificationsTable = pgTable('verifications', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  identifier: text('identifier').notNull(), // email address
  value: text('value').notNull(), // token hash
  expiresAt: timestamp('expires_at').notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at')
    .defaultNow()
    .$onUpdate(() => new Date())
    .notNull(),
});
```

---

### 7.4 Credit Types Table

**Description:** Defines categories of sponsor credits with display information and redemption instructions.

**Schema Definition:**

```typescript
// packages/core/src/business.server/events/schemas/credit-types.sql.ts
import { boolean, index, integer, pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

import { cuidId, timestamps } from '~/drizzle.server/types';

export const CreditTypesTable = pgTable(
  'credit_types',
  {
    id: cuidId('id'),
    name: text('name').notNull().unique(), // Internal key: 'cursor', 'anthropic'
    displayName: text('display_name').notNull(), // UI display: 'Cursor Pro Credits - 50 credits'
    emailInstructions: text('email_instructions').notNull(), // Concise text for email
    webInstructions: text('web_instructions').notNull(), // Detailed HTML/Markdown for dashboard
    displayOrder: integer('display_order').notNull().default(0),
    iconUrl: text('icon_url'), // Sponsor logo URL
    isActive: boolean('is_active').notNull().default(true),
    ...timestamps,
  },
  (table) => [
    index('credit_types_display_order_idx').on(table.displayOrder),
    index('credit_types_is_active_idx').on(table.isActive),
  ]
);

export type CreditType = typeof CreditTypesTable.$inferSelect;
export type NewCreditType = typeof CreditTypesTable.$inferInsert;
```

**Field Details:**

| Field             | Type        | Nullable | Default | Description                                                          |

| isActive          | boolean     | No       | true    | Whether codes of this type are assigned during registration check-in |

**Example Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO credit_types (id, name, display_name, email_instructions, web_instructions, display_order, icon_url, is_active) VALUES

import { UsersTable } from '~/auth/schema';
import { cuidId, timestamps } from '~/drizzle.server/types';

import { CreditTypesTable } from './credit-types.sql';

export const codeStatusEnum = pgEnum('code_status', ['unassigned', 'available', 'redeemed']);

export const CodesTable = pgTable(
  'codes',
  {
    id: cuidId('id'),
    creditTypeId: text('credit_type_id')
      .notNull()
      .references(() => CreditTypesTable.id, { onDelete: 'restrict' }),
    codeValue: text('code_value').notNull(), // The actual redemption code
    redeemUrl: text('redeem_url').notNull(), // URL where code is redeemed
    assignedTo: text('assigned_to').references(() => UsersTable.id, { onDelete: 'set null' }),
    assignedAt: timestamp('assigned_at'),
    redeemedAt: timestamp('redeemed_at'), // Self-reported by participant
    status: codeStatusEnum('status').notNull().default('unassigned'),
    ...timestamps,
  },
  (table) => [
    // Critical index for first-come-first-serve assignment query
    index('codes_assignment_idx').on(table.creditTypeId, table.status),
    // For looking up participant's assigned codes
    index('codes_assigned_to_idx').on(table.assignedTo),
    // Unique code per credit type (prevent duplicate imports)
    index('codes_unique_per_type_idx').on(table.creditTypeId, table.codeValue),
  ]
);

export type Code = typeof CodesTable.$inferSelect;
export type NewCode = typeof CodesTable.$inferInsert;
```

**Field Details:**

| Field        | Type        | Nullable | Default      | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | text (cuid) | No       | auto         | Primary key                                         |
| creditTypeId | text        | No       | -            | FK to credit_types                                  |
| codeValue    | text        | No       | -            | The actual redemption code string                   |
| redeemUrl    | text        | No       | -            | URL where participant redeems code                  |
| assignedTo   | text        | Yes      | null         | FK to users (participant who received code)         |
| assignedAt   | timestamp   | Yes      | null         | When code was assigned during registration check-in |
| redeemedAt   | timestamp   | Yes      | null         | When participant marked as redeemed                 |
| status       | enum        | No       | 'unassigned' | Lifecycle: unassigned → available → redeemed        |

**Status Lifecycle:**

1. `unassigned` - Imported but not assigned to anyone
2. `available` - Assigned to participant during registration check-in, not yet redeemed
3. `redeemed` - Participant self-reported as redeemed

**Code Assignment Query (with row-level locking):**

```typescript
// First-come-first-serve assignment with PostgreSQL FOR UPDATE
const assignCodeToParticipant = async (tx: Transaction, creditTypeId: string, participantId: string) => {
  // Lock one unassigned code
  const [code] = await tx
    .select()
    .from(CodesTable)
    .where(and(eq(CodesTable.creditTypeId, creditTypeId), eq(CodesTable.status, 'unassigned')))
    .limit(1)
    .for('update', { skipLocked: true }); // Skip already-locked rows

  if (!code) return null; // Pool exhausted

  // Assign to participant
  await tx
    .update(CodesTable)
    .set({
      assignedTo: participantId,
      assignedAt: new Date(),
      status: 'available',
    })
    .where(eq(CodesTable.id, code.id));

  return code;
};
```

| displayOrder | int         | No       | 0       | Order in ops UI                   |
| isActive     | boolean     | No       | true    | Can disable without deleting      |

### 7.7 Check-in Records Table

**Description:** Records of participant check-ins. Prevents duplicates per check-in type.

**Schema Definition:**

```typescript
// packages/core/src/business.server/events/schemas/checkin-records.sql.ts
import { index, pgTable, text, timestamp, unique } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

import { UsersTable } from '~/auth/schema';
import { cuidId } from '~/drizzle.server/types';

import { CheckinTypesTable } from './checkin-types.sql';

export const CheckinRecordsTable = pgTable(
  'checkin_records',
  {
    id: cuidId('id'),
    checkinTypeId: text('checkin_type_id')
      .notNull()
      .references(() => CheckinTypesTable.id, { onDelete: 'restrict' }),
    participantId: text('participant_id')
      .notNull()
      .references(() => UsersTable.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
    checkedInBy: text('checked_in_by')
      .notNull()
      .references(() => UsersTable.id, { onDelete: 'restrict' }),
    checkedInAt: timestamp('checked_in_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
  },
  (table) => [
    unique('checkin_records_type_participant_unq').on(table.checkinTypeId, table.participantId),
    index('checkin_records_participant_idx').on(table.participantId),
    index('checkin_records_checked_in_at_idx').on(table.checkedInAt),
  ]
);

export type CheckinRecord = typeof CheckinRecordsTable.$inferSelect;
export type NewCheckinRecord = typeof CheckinRecordsTable.$inferInsert;
```

**Field Details:**

| Field         | Type        | Nullable | Default | Description                   |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| id            | text (cuid) | No       | auto    | Primary key                   |

| checkedInAt   | timestamp   | No       | now()   | When checked in               |

**Duplicate Prevention:**

The unique constraint `(checkin_type_id, participant_id)` prevents duplicate check-ins:

```typescript
const processCheckin = async (checkinTypeId: string, participantId: string, opsUserId: string) => {
  try {
    await db.insert(CheckinRecordsTable).values({
      checkinTypeId,
      participantId,
      checkedInBy: opsUserId,
    });
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === '23505') {
      // PostgreSQL unique violation
      const existing = await db.query.CheckinRecordsTable.findFirst({
        where: and(
          eq(CheckinRecordsTable.checkinTypeId, checkinTypeId),
          eq(CheckinRecordsTable.participantId, participantId)
        ),
      });
      return {
        success: false,
        error: `Already checked in at ${existing?.checkedInAt}`,
      };
    }
    throw error;
  }
};
```

import { env } from '~/config/env';

interface QRPayload {
  participantId: string;
  type: 'permanent';
  signature: string;
}

export const generateQRCodeValue = (participantId: string): string => {
  const payload = {
    participantId,
    type: 'permanent' as const,
  };

  const signature = createHmac('sha256', env.QR_SECRET_KEY).update(JSON.stringify(payload)).digest('hex');

  const fullPayload: QRPayload = { ...payload, signature };

  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(fullPayload)).toString('base64url');
};

export const verifyQRCodeValue = (
  qrValue: string
): { valid: true; participantId: string } | { valid: false; error: string } => {
  try {
    const decoded = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(qrValue, 'base64url').toString()) as QRPayload;

    const expectedPayload = {
      participantId: decoded.participantId,
      type: decoded.type,
    };

    const expectedSignature = createHmac('sha256', env.QR_SECRET_KEY)
      .update(JSON.stringify(expectedPayload))
      .digest('hex');

    if (decoded.signature !== expectedSignature) {
      return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid signature' };
    }

    return { valid: true, participantId: decoded.participantId };
  } catch {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid QR format' };
  }
};
```

**Environment Variable Required:**

```typescript
// Add to packages/core/src/config/env.ts
const EnvSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing
  QR_SECRET_KEY: z.string().min(32), // Minimum 32 chars for security
  RESEND_API_KEY: z.string().min(1),
});

## 9. Technical Stack

This section documents all technology choices, architecture decisions, deployment strategy, and infrastructure requirements.

### 9.1 Frontend Architecture

**Description:** Frontend framework selection, state management, routing, and build configuration.

**Technologies:**
- **TanStack Start** - React 19 full-stack framework with file-based routing
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management and data fetching
- **Tailwind v4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn UI** - Accessible component library (via `@base/ui`)
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server

**Key Patterns:**
- Server functions for backend operations (in `apps/web/src/apis/`)
- Path aliases: `~/*` for same-package, `@base/core/*`, `@base/ui/*`
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

### 9.2 Backend Architecture

**Description:** Backend platform, API design, database setup, and server functions.

**Technologies:**
- **TanStack Start Server Functions** - RPC-style backend operations
- **TanStack Start Server Routes** - Stable URLs for webhooks/auth callbacks
- **Better Auth** - Authentication with magic link plugin
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database queries

**API Structure:**
- Server functions in `apps/web/src/apis/` for UI-triggered operations
- Server routes for external integrations (auth callbacks, webhooks)
- Business logic in `packages/core/src/business.server/events/`

---

### 9.3 Database Design

**Description:** Database technology, schema design, indexing strategy, and data migration approach.

**Technologies:**
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database with row-level locking support
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe schema definitions and queries
- **Drizzle Kit** - Migration generation and management

**Migration Commands:**
```bash
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migration from schema changes
pnpm db:migrate   # Apply migrations to database
pnpm db:push      # Quick schema sync (development only)
````

**Index Strategy:**

- `codes(credit_type_id, status)` - First-come-first-serve code assignment
- `codes(assigned_to)` - Participant's assigned codes lookup
- `checkin_records(checkin_type_id, participant_id)` - Unique constraint + lookup
- `users(email, luma_id, status, role)` - Various lookup patterns

---

### 9.4 Authentication & Authorization

**Description:** Authentication flow implementation, session management, and role-based access control.

**Technologies:**

- **Better Auth** - Core authentication framework
- **Magic Link Plugin** - Passwordless email authentication
- **Drizzle Adapter** - Database integration

**Configuration:**

```typescript
// Session: 7 days with daily refresh
session: {
  expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7,
  updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24,
}

// Magic Link: 1 hour expiry, signup disabled
magicLink({
  expiresIn: 60 * 60,
  disableSignUp: true, // Only pre-imported users
})
```

**Role-Based Access:**
| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| participant | Own dashboard, QR code, credits |
| ops | Scanner interface, check-in processing |
| admin | Full access, imports, management |

**Authorization Middleware Pattern:**

```typescript
const requireRole = (allowedRoles: UserRole[]) => {
  return async (ctx) => {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession(ctx);
    if (!session || !allowedRoles.includes(session.user.role)) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized');
    }
    return session;
  };
};
```

**Description:** QR code generation library, encoding strategy, signature algorithm, and scanning library.

**Technologies:**

- **qrcode** - QR code image generation (PNG/SVG)
- **html5-qrcode** - Camera-based QR scanning in browser
- **crypto** (Node.js) - HMAC-SHA256 signature generation

**Payload Format:**

```json
{
  "participantId": "cuid_xxx",
  "type": "permanent",
  "signature": "hmac_sha256_hex"
}
```

**Encoding:** Base64URL encoded JSON payload

**Security:**

- HMAC-SHA256 signature using `QR_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Server-side validation only (never trust client)
- Signature verified before any action
- Permanent QR (no timestamp/expiry in payload)

**Generation Flow:**

1. User created/imported → `qr_code_value` generated and stored
2. Dashboard displays QR from stored value
3. Check-in email embeds QR as PNG image

**Validation Flow:**

1. Ops scans QR → decode base64url → parse JSON
2. Verify HMAC signature matches
3. Lookup participant by `participantId`
4. Process check-in
